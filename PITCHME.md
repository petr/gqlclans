# Schema in python

https://github.com/petr/gqlclans/blob/master/gqlclans/schema.py

```
    class Member(graphene.ObjectType):
        name = graphene.String()
        account_id = graphene.ID()
        role = graphene.String()

    class Message(graphene.ObjectType):
        body = graphene.String()

    class Clan(graphene.ObjectType):
        name = graphene.String()
        tag = graphene.String()
        clan_id = graphene.ID()
        color = graphene.String()
        members = graphene.List(Member)
        messages = graphene.List(Message)
```

# Schema and aioHttp

```
from aiohttp import web
from aiohttp_graphql import GraphQLView

from gqlclans.schema import schema

app = web.Application()

graphql_view = GraphQLView(schema=schema, batch=True)
app.router.add_route('*', '/graphql', graphql_view)

```
